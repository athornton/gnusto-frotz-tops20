# Gnusto-Frotz-Tops20

## Status

Frotz is now based on 2.45pre (https://gitlab.com/DavidGriffith/frotz/,
master branch).  It seems to play the Infocom games and a smattering of
community-written Z-code games.  So far only the "dumb-frotz" TTY
interface is supported.

Its behavior on `praxix.z5`is identical to that of the x86_64 version.

## The Reason It Wasn't Trivial

```
@type testc.c
#include <stdio.h>
int main ( int argc, char **argv) {
    char c=-1;
    short s=-1;
    printf("Max unsigned char is %d\n", (unsigned char) c);
    printf("Max unsigned short is %d\n", (unsigned short) s);
}
@cc -o testc testc.c
KCC:   TESTC
 "testc.c", line 8: [Note] Parameter "argc" not used
       (main+6, p.1 l.7): "Max unsigned short is %d\n", (unsigned short) s); }

 "testc.c", line 8: [Note] Parameter "argv" not used
       (main+6, p.1 l.7): "Max unsigned short is %d\n", (unsigned short) s); }

```

And this line in the Dumb-Frotz README, in the CAVEATS:

```
     - lack of 8-bit char and 16-bit short.  I didn't bother to think
       much about this.  If you're using a 36-bit Honeywell or
       something, let me know.
```

## Introduction

### What?

This program has only one function: create a version of dumb-frotz that
is playable on TOPS-20 on a PDP-10.

It does this by acquiring a fork of frotz, assembling the sources into a
single directory, transmogrifying it so that the TOPS-20 compiler
doesn't choke and its linker can handle the symbols, and outputting the
mogrified sources.

This isn't as easy as it sounds, because:

[https://github.com/PDP-10/panda/blob/master/files/kcc-6/kcc/user.doc#L519]

```
However, the situation is different for symbols with external
linkage, which must be exported to the PDP-10 linker.  Such names are
truncated to 6 characters and case is no longer significant.
```
So you need to map all the symbols in the header files, everything declared
"extern" in the source files, and also make sure that your input file names
are unambiguous and no more than six characters before the extension.

But even that's not enough, because there are a number of places where
Frotz is assuming 8-bit chars and 16-bit shorts.  So now
`gnusto-frotz-tops20` pulls from my fork of the sources at
https://github.com/athornton/tops20-frotz, where I've been hacking to
sanitize the code such that TOPS-20 is happy with it.  I think I have
finally succeeded.

### Why?

To bring Zork back home.

More generally, with the dump of "The Infocom Drive" showing up on the
Internet, I decided it'd be fun to be able to play Z-machine files on a
PDP-10, as God and Nature intended.

## Usage

You will need a Perl 5 interpreter with the standard Perl libraries, a
working `sed`, and a working `git`.  You will need to be in a writeable
directory.

### Generating compilable source

In there, just execute `gnusto-frotz-tops20`.  This will generate a
bunch of files in the `output` directory.

### Compiling that source

Copy those files to a TOPS-20 system (e.g. FTP in text mode) that has
KCC installed, and compile them with `cc -o frotz *.c`.  That will
generate `frotz.exe`, which is the TOPS-20 executable.

I'm using
[the late Mark Crispin's "Panda" distribution of TOPS-20](http://panda.trailing-edge.com/)
and the [klh10](https://github.com/DavidGriffith/klh10) interpreter.

### Running a game

From the directory containing `frotz`, `frotz <directory>game` does the
trick.

### Future steps

I presume there's an OK curses library for KCC, although I haven't
looked.  The PDP-10 certainly should be able to talk to a VT-100 or one
of its successors, so we should be able to do a pretty decent
representation of all the non-graphical games.
